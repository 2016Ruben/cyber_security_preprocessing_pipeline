# Requirements

Used modules as we have them installed on our system:

- matplotlib==3.8.1
- PyYAML==5.4.1
- scikit-learn==1.3.2
- seaborn==0.13.0
- tensorflow==2.15.0

The full list contained in our virtual environment can be found in requirements.txt.

Additionally, for the Kitsune hook we have used:
- Cython==3.0.8
- scapy==2.5.0

Alternatively, tshark can be used instead of scapy, leading to faster
code execution, see [original authors](https://github.com/ymirsky/Kitsune-py/tree/master).
